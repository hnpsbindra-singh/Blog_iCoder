iCoder – Blog Website

iCoder is a responsive and modern blog website created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. It is designed as a beginner-friendly yet practical project to demonstrate frontend development skills, UI/UX design principles, and the integration of reusable Bootstrap components.

The website consists of three main sections:

Home (Tutorial.html) – The landing page features an interactive carousel that highlights random images with captions, demonstrating JavaScript integration for dynamic image display. Below the carousel, the page includes blog-style content cards covering topics like development, coding practices, and clean code principles. Each card is structured with Bootstrap’s grid system and responsive layout, ensuring that the content adapts well to different screen sizes.

About Us (about.html) – This section introduces the purpose behind iCoder. It contains featurettes with text and images that explain why the blog was started, the passion driving it, and the long-term vision of the platform. It helps users connect with the idea that iCoder is not just a blog but a space for sharing knowledge and inspiration.

Contact Us (contact.html) – A functional contact form built with Bootstrap forms. It allows users to enter their details, including email, OTP (for demonstration), address, city, and state. The form is styled using Bootstrap classes and showcases form validation and responsive alignment. This section emphasizes usability and accessibility.
